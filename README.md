📝 Introduction
In this project, we analyze a dataset of used cars to predict their selling prices. The main goals are:

To understand the factors affecting car prices.
To improve model accuracy through various data processing techniques.
To evaluate and compare the performance of multiple machine learning models.
📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

Car_Name: Name of the car.
Year: Manufacturing year.
Present_Price: Price of the car when new (in lakhs INR).
Kms_Driven: Distance driven (in kilometers).
Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/CNG).
Seller_Type: Type of seller (Dealer/Individual).
Transmission: Type of transmission (Manual/Automatic).
Owner: Number of previous owners.
Selling_Price: Selling price of the car (in lakhs INR) - Target variable.
🔄 Project Workflow
Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed the distribution of numerical features such as Present_Price and Kms_Driven.
Investigated relationships between features and the target variable through visualizations:
Bar plots
Scatter plots
Box plots
Step 2: Feature Engineering
Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., Car_Name).
Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
Log-transformed skewed features (Present_Price, Kms_Driven).
Step 3: Model Evaluation
Tested multiple regression models, including:
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
AdaBoost
Achieved the best performance with Random Forest Regressor, with:
R² Score: 0.956
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.465
Step 4: Outlier Handling
Identified and removed outliers in key features.
Reassessed model performance, achieving significant improvement.
Step 5: Cross-Validation
Performed 5-fold cross-validation on the final model to ensure consistency.
📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights:

Present_Price and Kms_Driven show right-skewed distributions.
Cars with automatic transmission and diesel fuel type have higher average selling prices.
Older cars tend to have lower selling prices.
Visualizations include:

Histogram of Present_Price and Kms_Driven.
Bar plots of categorical features like Fuel_Type vs. Selling_Price.
Scatter plots for relationships between numeric features.
🔧 Feature Engineering
Removed irrelevant features (e.g., Car_Name).
Applied log transformation to reduce skewness.
Encoded categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.
🤖 Model Evaluation
The following table highlights the performance of various models:

Model	R² Score	MSE	MAE
Random Forest	0.956	0.655	0.465
Decision Tree	0.952	0.714	0.516
Gradient Boosting	0.923	1.151	0.548
AdaBoost	0.898	1.513	0.925
Linear Regression	0.808	2.860	1.141
Support Vector Regression	-0.219	18.162	2.852
Random Forest achieved the highest R² score of 0.956, making it the best model for this project.

🔍 Conclusion
The Random Forest Regressor proved to be the most accurate model, with a 96% R² score.
Proper handling of outliers and skewed data significantly improved model performance.
The project demonstrates the importance of preprocessing in machine learning pipelines.
🚀 Future Improvements
Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for the best-performing models.
Test advanced ensemble methods like XGBoost or LightGBM.
Incorporate additional features, such as car brand or location, for better predictions.
Deploy the model as a web application for real-world usage.
